    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 lemons, zested and juiced, divided</li>
        <li> 3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-1/2x4-1/2-inch loaf pan with butter.</li>
        <li>Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Combine white sugar and lemon zest in a bowl. Rub lemon zest into the sugar with your fingers until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Combine eggs, yogurt, juice of 1 lemon, and vanilla extract in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixture until blended. Add flour mixture and sugar mixture; beat on low speed until batter is just combined. Fold in olive oil gently using a spatula.</li>
        <li>Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. Let cool in the pan, at least 30 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of the pan to loosen; invert onto a serving dish.</li>
        <li>Whisk remaining lemon juice and confectioners' sugar together in a bowl to make a thin glaze. Drizzle glaze over cake.</li>
    </ol>
