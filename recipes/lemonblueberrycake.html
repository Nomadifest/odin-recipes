    <h3>Delicious Lemon Blueberry Cake</h3>
    <p>This lemon blueberry cake made with fresh blueberries, lemon zest, and sour cream is lovely and moist. It's hard to stop going back for more!</p>
    <p>Personally, I’m already starting to drool just looking at the picture, let's get started!</p>
    <h4>Lemon Blueberry Cake Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Butter</strong> and <strong>flour</strong>: Prevent sticking by buttering and flouring the sides of a 9-inch springform pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Berries</strong>: Choose fresh blueberries that are fragrant and deeply colored. Avoid ones that appear bruised or wrinkly.</li>
        <li><strong>Lemon</strong>: You’ll need a tablespoon + one teaspoon of fresh lemon juice. You’ll also need fresh lemon zest</li>
        <li><strong>Sugars</strong>: Use white granulated sugar for the cake batter and dust the finished cake with confectioners’ sugar before serving.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Two large eggs give the cake richness and flavor. Make sure your eggs are room temperature before incorporating them into the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Sour cream</strong>: A cup of sour cream adds even more richness and moisture. Plus, it gives the cake a subtle tangy flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Oil</strong>: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, is essential for this moist and dense lemon blueberry cake.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla</strong> and <strong>salt</strong>: Vanilla extract and a pinch of salt enhance the overall flavor of the citrusy cake.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour</strong>: All-purpose flour gives the cake structure. Tossing the berries in flour, meanwhile, will help prevent them from sinking.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking powder</strong>: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cake rise.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>How to Make Lemon Blueberry Cake</h4>
    <ol>
